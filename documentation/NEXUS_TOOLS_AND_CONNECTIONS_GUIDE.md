## Connection System

### Connection Types
The game features a dynamic connection system that determines tool availability:

#### Active Connections ✅
- **Basic Access**: Standard network connection
- **Network Access**: Deep network penetration
- **Social Data**: Social engineering intelligence

#### Pending Connections ⏳
- **Advanced Access**: Elevated system privileges
- **System Access**: Core system integration
- **Biometric Data**: Biometric authentication data

#### Locked Connections 🔒
- **Core Access**: Critical system access
- **Admin Access**: Administrative privileges
- **Quantum Key**: Quantum encryption access

### Connection Requirements
Each tool requires specific connections to function:
- **Basic tools** require only standard network access
- **Advanced tools** need elevated privileges or specialized data
- **Elite tools** require rare connections like quantum keys or core access

## Mission Integration

### Tool Selection Strategy
Different missions favor different tool categories:

#### Stealth Missions (Phantom Protocol)
- Prioritize stealth and reconnaissance tools
- Minimize trace generation
- Focus on invisible operations

#### Assault Missions (Data Fortress)
- Use disruption and assault tools
- Accept higher trace levels for faster progress
- Create diversions and chaos

#### Infiltration Missions (Biometric Bluff)
- Combine infiltration and analysis tools
- Use social engineering effectively
- Escalate privileges systematically

### Cooldown Management
- Tools have cooldown periods after use
- Plan tool usage strategically
- Some tools can reduce cooldowns of others

### Trace Risk Assessment
Tools generate different levels of trace risk:
- **Negative**: Actually reduces trace levels
- **Very Low**: Minimal detection risk
- **Low**: Safe for regular use
- **Medium**: Moderate risk, use carefully
- **High**: Significant risk, use sparingly
- **Very High**: Extreme risk, emergency use only

## Advanced Strategies

### Tool Synergies
Certain tool combinations are more effective:
- **Network Scanner + Packet Sniffer**: Complete network intelligence
- **Identity Forge + Social Engineer**: Perfect impersonation
- **Trace Cleaner + Ghost Protocol**: Ultimate stealth combination

### Connection Progression
Connections can be upgraded during missions:
1. Start with basic connections
2. Use tools to establish new connections
3. Unlock advanced capabilities
4. Access elite tools and systems

### Risk vs. Reward
Balance tool effectiveness against trace generation:
- High-risk tools provide major advantages
- Low-risk tools allow sustained operations
- Emergency tools can save failed missions

## Tool Usage Tips

### For New Players
1. Start with reconnaissance tools to understand the target
2. Use low-risk tools to maintain stealth
3. Save high-risk tools for critical moments
4. Always have an exit strategy

### For Advanced Players
1. Plan tool sequences for maximum efficiency
2. Use tool synergies to amplify effects
3. Manage cooldowns across multiple tools
4. Balance risk and reward dynamically

### For Expert Players
1. Master connection manipulation
2. Use negative-trace tools strategically
3. Create complex tool chains
4. Adapt strategies based on mission evolution

## Connection Establishment Guide

### How to Gain New Connections
1. **Mission Progress**: Some connections unlock automatically
2. **Tool Usage**: Certain tools can establish new connections
3. **Objective Completion**: Specific objectives grant connection access
4. **Agent Abilities**: Some agents have connection bonuses

### Connection Maintenance
- Connections can be lost if detected
- Some connections are temporary
- Backup connections are recommended
- Connection quality affects tool effectiveness

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Tool Unavailable**: Check connection requirements
- **High Cooldown**: Plan tool usage sequence better
- **Trace Spike**: Use stealth tools to reduce detection
- **Connection Lost**: Re-establish using appropriate tools
